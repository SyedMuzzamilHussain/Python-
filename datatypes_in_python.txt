Got it! Here's a quick rundown of just the four basic data types you're asking about:

1. int (Integer)
- Represents whole numbers (both positive and negative).
- Example: `x = 10`  
- Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
- Can represent both small and large numbers.
  
 2. float (Floating Point)
- Represents numbers with a decimal point.
- Example: `y = 3.14`  
- Used for precise calculations like scientific calculations, measurements, etc.
  
 3. char(Character)
- Python doesn't have a specific "char" data type like other languages (e.g., C or Java).
- In Python, a single character is just a string with a length of 1.
  - Example: `char = 'A'`  
  - You can use string methods for characters as well.
  
4. bool (Boolean)
- Represents one of two values: `True` or `False`.
- Example: `is_active = True`  
- Used for conditional checks (e.g., in `if` statements, loops, etc.)
