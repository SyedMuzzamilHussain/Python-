Python Operators

Python operators are special symbols used to perform specific operations on one or more operands. The variables, values, or expressions can be used as operands. For example, Python's addition operator (+) is used to perform addition operations on two variables, values, or expressions.

Unary operators: Python operators that require one operand to perform a specific operation are known as unary operators.

Binary operators: Python operators that require two operands to perform a specific operation are known as binary operators.

Types of Python Operators
Python operators are categorized in the following categories −

Arithmetic Operators
Comparison (Relational) Operators
Assignment Operators
Logical Operators

Python Arithmetic Operators
Python Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

Operator      Name	         Example
+	    Addition		a + b = 30
-	    Subtraction		a – b = -10
*	 Multiplication		a * b = 200
/	    Division		b / a = 2
%	Modulus			b % a = 0
**	   Exponent		a**b =10**20
//	 Floor Division		9//2 = 4


Python Comparison Operators
Python Comparison operators compare the values on either side of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called Relational operators.

Operator	Name		Example
==		Equal		(a == b) is not true.
!=		Not equal	(a != b) is true.
>		Greater than	(a > b) is not true.
<		Less than	(a < b) is true.
>=		Greater than or equal to	(a >= b) is not true.
<=		Less than or equal to	(a <= b) is true.

Python Assignment Operators
Python Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Following is a table which shows all Python assignment operators.

Operator	Example		Same As
=		a = 10		a = 10
+=		a += 30		a = a + 30
-=		a -= 15		a = a - 15
*=		a *= 10		a = a * 10
/=		a /= 5		a = a / 5
%=		a %= 5		a = a % 5
**=		a **= 4		a = a ** 4
//=		a //= 5		a = a // 5

Python Logical Operators
Python logical operators are used to combile two or more conditions and check the final result. There are following logical operators supported by Python language. Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then.

Operator	Name	Example
and		AND	a and b
or		OR	a or b
not		NOT	not(a)
